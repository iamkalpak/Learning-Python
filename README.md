# 30-Day Python Learning Challenge

Welcome to the **30-Day Python Learning Challenge**! This guide is designed to help you learn Python from scratch in one month. Each day builds on the previous lessons, and by the end, you'll have a solid foundation in Python programming. This journey covers basic syntax, data structures, file handling, object-oriented programming, and even a bit of web scraping and data analysis.
